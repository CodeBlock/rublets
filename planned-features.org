* The idea
** Really, Rublets is just a place for me to experiment with SELinux Sandboxes. They are awesome, and open up a lot of possibilities for doing some really cool stuff.
** This bot is my chance to work out issues with some ideas, and generally experiment. Once I am confident in my understanding of how to work around issues that arise, I plan to do some other projects using the same technology.

* The implementation
** When the project started out, it was going to be Ruby-only. That has changed. The bot is still in Ruby, but that can change too. There are no ties to any language.
** There are, however, ties to an enforcing SELinux system, on the server that runs the bot.

* Languages
** DONE Ruby
*** TODO Needs better documentation for how to set it up.
** TODO Scala, Java, Clojure, $your_favorite_jvm_language
*** TODO Work out how to make JVM start up fast, or a *secure* way to leave a persistent JVM open that sandboxes can connect to.
** TODO Io
** TODO Lua
** TODO Javascript
** TODO Erlang
** TODO Common Lisp
** TODO Mono-based Languages.
** TODO Perl
** TODO PHP
** TODO Haskell
** TODO C/C++
** TODO $your_favorite_language

* Note that for complexity sake, and my sanity, I'd like to ask that any language added here be already packaged for Fedora. At least in a repo somewhere, if not in Fedora base repos.
