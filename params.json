{"name":"Rublets","body":"### Welcome to Rublets\r\nRublets is a code evaluation IRC bot which uses selinux's `sandbox` command to safely allow for evaluation and compilation of code by users in an irc channel.\r\n\r\n```irc\r\n<CodeBlock> !perl6> print \"Hello!\";\r\n<rublets> Hello!\r\n<CodeBlock> !io> \"Hello world!\" println\r\n<rublets> Hello world!\r\n<CodeBlock> !io> \"Hello world!\" utoh_syntax_error\r\n<rublets>   Exception: Sequence does not respond to 'utoh_syntax_error'\r\n<rublets> <output truncated> https://gist.github.com/2faf508b0415df2b4c76\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Setting Rublets up\r\nUnfortunately, Rublets is a bit complex to set up, due to the nature of how it works.\r\n\r\nAt minimum, Rublets requires:\r\n* SELinux (**enforcing!**)\r\n* `sandbox` (In Fedora, this is found in the `policycoreutils-python` package)\r\n* Interpreters for each language that Rublets supports, or each language that you wish to allow evaluations for.\r\n** See the readme for a list of languages that it can currently evaluate.\r\n\r\nRublets doesn't require anything special beyond this, however. It doesn't need its own server, or even its own user account.\r\n\r\nYou can daemonize it with `nohup`, or just do like I do, and run it in `tmux` or `screen`.","tagline":"An IRC bot that uses SELinux Sandboxes to let you evaluate code in a large number languages","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
